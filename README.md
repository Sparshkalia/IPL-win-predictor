## 🔥 About the Project

This project predicts the **winning probability** of an IPL team during a live match based on:

- Current score 🏏  
- Overs left ⏳  
- Wickets remaining 🚑  
- Target score 🎯

I built this project as a practical application of supervised learning using real-world IPL data. It combines data preprocessing, EDA, model building, and web app deployment for a full-stack ML experience.
